mod laravel project

# TODO

- Go thru the composer.json file and read up on the packages especially nwidart/modules, danielme85/laravel-log-to-db, inertiajs, tightenco/ziggy, webparking/laravel-queue-ensurer

- Go thru the package.json and familiarise yourself with the following packages: clean-webpack-plugin, laravel-mix-purgecss, laravel-mix-svelte, 

- Composer install and npm install

- Npm run watch to run the project

- Next create a new branch

- Next in the PublicPages Module's resource folder there is a template folder. That contains the template we are attempting to build out. See if you can use npm to build the necessary files and make the page look fine.
